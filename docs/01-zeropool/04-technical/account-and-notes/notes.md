# Notes

The note specifies an available user's assets. It indicates that an asset is held by the owner of the spending key $$\sigma$$which was used to [derive the private address](../zeropool-keys/address-derivation.md).

A private address is a value strictly associated with the user account. It consists of:

1. &#x20;a random value called a diversifier and&#x20;
2. a diversified public key derived from the diversifier using the spending key.

The note is created by the asset sender. A note and its hash are placed in transaction.

A note is a tuple $$(d, P_d, b, t)$$where

* $$d$$ (10 bytes) is a diversifier (a random value generated by a note owner)
* $$P_d$$ (32 bytes) is diversified public key (a value derived from the $$d$$ and spending key $$\sigma$$)
* $$b$$(8 bytes) is a note balance (an asset amount transferred by this note)
* $$t$$(10 bytes) is a salt. Since the transaction contains note hashes we must use a random salt to hide notes with the same owners and balances.

Due to the private nature of transactions, all notes are encrypted. They can be decrypted by a sender or receiver (note owner) only.&#x20;

The sender decrypts notes to obtain the outcome transaction history. The note receiver (owner) can decrypt it with the spending key $$\sigma$$ which was used to generate a [private address](../zeropool-keys/address-derivation.md) $$(d, P_d)$$specified in the note.

#### Zero note

There is an additional state for the note. When a user creates a transaction one or more zero output notes may be created. They will be ignored during transaction parsing. In such a note **all** fields are zero.
